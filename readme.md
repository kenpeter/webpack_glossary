# Intro

I found that there are lots of unfamiliar terms in Webpack configuration. When I first time encounter
those terms, I read the official doc, examples, Stackoverflow, etc. I still have
no idea what they are talking about, but I am able to find a better explanation in a Youtube video.
This repository hosts video (mostly) and text explanation of a particular term in Webpack. Contribution is welcome and sorry
about my English.

I realise that it is very important to know a particular term in deeper level.

# Sample Webpack config file from [here](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/yt-webpack2-basics/blob/06-webpack-babel-scss-img-html/webpack.config.js)

```

var ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin');
var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
var CleanWebpackPlugin = require('clean-webpack-plugin');

var extractPlugin = new ExtractTextPlugin({
   filename: 'main.css'
});

module.exports = {
    entry: './src/js/app.js',
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: 'bundle.js',
        // publicPath: '/dist'
    },
    module: {
